# sc2-swarm-intelligence

## Summary
The following project explores a new territory which merges swarm intelligence along with StarCraft 2 platform also knowns as sc2. The aim is to create a new platform and set up fundamentals to implement swarm like behaviour in new environments. A set of experiments were carried out to and the swarm behaviour was observed. Python was the language used to write the code using a sc2 library to control the sc2 platform. Furthermore, the SC2 Map creator was used to create the environment along with scenarios required.
